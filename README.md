# Javascript Functions

## Lesson Objective:
**To declare and call functions in JavaScript**

## How do we declare variables:
    var name = 'bob';
## This is how we declare a function:
    function sayHi() {
      return 'Hi'
    }
Notice we use var and then a name and then assign this 'bob'. In the second case we tell javascript we are making a *function* and then put the name of our function*sayhi* next to `()`. The code block  --what we want the function to do-- we put in curly brackets `{}`.
## Lets take a second to put the above code in our console in an open web-browser

To open up your dev-tools in chrome the shortcut is  `option` `command` `j`

To open up your dev-tools in firefox the command is `option` `command` `k`

## Great we just declared a function!
Congratulations you are on your way to being a developer. Functions are how we tell the computer to do things. Html and Css can put words on a page and style them, but if we actually want our user to interact with a page, we need JavaScript functions.
-So how do we call a function?

## To call a function:
Go ahead and type this in your console:
    `sayHi`

Talk to the person next to you, did it do what you thought it would? What do we know about sayHi?

We need to go ahead and type these all important `( )`  in our code. So now type in `sayHi()` and see what we get
