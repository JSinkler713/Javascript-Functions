# Javascript Functions

## Lesson Objective:
**To declare and call functions in JavaScript**

## How do we declare variables:
    var name = 'bob';
## We can declare a function similarly:
    function sayHi() {
      return 'Hi'
    }
Notice we use var and then a name and then assign this 'bob'. In the second case we tell javascript we are making a *function* and then put the name of our function*sayhi* next to `()`. The code block  --what we want the function to do-- we put in curly brackets {}.

## take a second to put this in our console in an open web-browser
