# Javascript Functions

## Lesson Objective:
**To declare and call functions in JavaScript**

## How do we declare variables:
    var name = 'bob';
## We can declare a function similarly:
    var sayName = function() {
      console.log("Hi I'm Bob");
    }
Notice we use var and then a name and then assign this for both the variable and the function. In the second case we tell javascript we are making a *function()* and then wrap our code --what we want the function to do-- in curly brackets {}.

## take a second to put this in our console in an open web-browser

To open up your dev-tools in chrome its `option` `command` `j`
To open up your dev-tools in firefox the command is `option` `command` `k`
